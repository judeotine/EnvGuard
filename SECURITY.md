Instead, please send an email to [judextine28@gmail.com](mailto:judextine28@gmail.com) with the subject line "[SECURITY] Vulnerability Report".

### Our Commitment

- We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. Always keep your VS Code and EnvGuard extension up to date
2. Review and customize the default patterns in your settings
3. Be cautious when sharing your screen or recording your development environment
4. Use environment-specific .env files (e.g., .env.development, .env.production)
5. Never commit .env files to version control

### For Developers

1. Follow the principle of least privilege
2. Use secure coding practices
3. Keep dependencies up to date
4. Review all third-party code before integration
5. Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
